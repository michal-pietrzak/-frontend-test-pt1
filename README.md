This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Frontend Test Part 1 - Solution

In the project I have used a few simplifications which ought to be considered:
* I used the `eval` method to calculate the expression. I realize this is a dangerous method and is not to be used in production code.
* Only integer numbers accepted on input.
* The result of last operation cannot be the first input to the new operation. Always a new expression is started.

Clone this git and run `yarn add`. This will install all the necessary dependencies.

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
